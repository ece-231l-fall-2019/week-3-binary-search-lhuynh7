### Review of the code

When creating this code I ran into many issues on how I would be able to get the results and timing of the program. After writing down what I should be expecting made visualizing the code a bit easier.  


# Without Optimizations

|Algorithm           |Time         |
|--------------------|-------------|
|Linear              |18.4272s     | 
|Linear (pointers)   |15.1374s     |    
|Binary              |0.000949238s |
|Binary (pointers)   |0.000856337s |
------------------------------------


# With Optimizations

|Algorithm           |Time         |
|--------------------|-------------|
|Linear              |14.1367s     |
|Linear (pointers)   |13.6677s     |
|Binary              |0.000960344s |
|Binary (pointers)   |0.000964609s |
------------------------------------


### SUMMARY

Although I was able to get some good results with and without Optimizations, It seem slower compared to the example that the professor had showed in class. I came to the conclusion that my speed and timing results were affected due to my hardware capability.
